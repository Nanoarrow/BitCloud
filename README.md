BitCloud uses OpenWeatherMap and location data to display your location and your current weather conditions. It is a slightly modified version of Pebblekit-js-weather. Infrequent updates will be made to this, just to make it easier for you to fork and create a better version. If you want to contribute, you know what to do.
